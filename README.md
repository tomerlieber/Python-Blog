# Python-Blog

Welcome to my new blog about Python!

The blog contains mostly posts about Python at a basic level.
It will help people who want to learn the language. 
However, even people with previous experience will be able to find helpful posts here.

You are welcome to <a href="http://ec2-18-219-61-101.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/"> enter the blog</a>, read some posts and give feedback.

**Currently the website is down.**

---

The blog was written in **JavaScript** (including features of ES6+), using the following technologics:
* **React** to create the user interface.
* **MongoDB** to store the amount of likes and comments that each post received.
* **Node.js** and **Express** to build the server that connects the UI to the DB.
* **AWS** to deploy the blog so everyone can use it.
