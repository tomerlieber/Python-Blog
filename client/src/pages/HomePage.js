    <p>
        Welcome to my new blog about Python!
        The blog contains mostly posts about Python at a basic level. 
        It will help people who want to learn the language. 
        However, even people who already know the language will be able to find helpful posts here.
        Feel free to comment on the posts and give a like if you liked what you read.
