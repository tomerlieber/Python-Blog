    <p>
        Hey, my name is Tomer.
        As a software developer with 4 years of experience, I advocate the principle of code reuse.
        So, instead of telling about myself here, I invite you to 
        visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomer-lieber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my linkein profile</a> and know me even better :)
